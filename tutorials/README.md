# Tutorials/examples for hallucination & inpainting

Open the Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb file) in Jupyter to follow along each
example. The actual outputs of design runs are included in each demo so you can
see what the files look like.

 - `halluc_PD-L1_binder/`: simple demo of hallucination to scaffold an
   interface motif to generate de novo mimics of PD-1 (to bind PD-L1).  The
   commands should all be able to run out-of-the-box on IPD digs; some
   modifications to the syntax/paths will probably be needed on other systems.

 - `halluc_SH3_binder`: more advanced binder hallucination example, with
   calculation of AF2 pae_interaction metric. Not as thoroughly annotated as
   PD-L1 example, but a more realistic practical example.
